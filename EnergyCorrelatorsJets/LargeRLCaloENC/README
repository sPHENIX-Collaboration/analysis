######################################  Large R_{L} Calorimeter Only Energy Correlators ####################################################


This analysis is intended to make measurements of the Energy-Energy Correlator up to large R_{L} across all of the Calorimeters (starting 
with the Outer HCAL) 

Intended uses are for a first measurement without tracking and additional studies in the vein of "Jet observables without Jets algorithms"

###################################### Output ##############################################################################

Root output is in a combination of TTrees and histograms

TTrees: Store one enetry per event

DijetKinematics--This is a TTree that holds a few branches
	N_{dijets}: Number of sets of jet (pt>pt_min) pairs that pass angular cut per event 
	A_jj_l: A_jj for the pT leading pair of dijets
	x_j_l: x_j for the pT leading pair of dijets
	Jet_PT: Map of calorimeter (stored as int): 
			Map of vertex corrected tower position [eta, phi, r]:
				p_T in tower (approximated via E/p ratio)  (WIP Branch)
	dijet_sets: branch holding array of pairs of dijet objects as 3 float array [pt_l, A_jj, x_j] for later analyzers

cuts_r[radius]--Stores information about the cuts to allow for QA of biasing in the cuts
	N_jets: number of identified jets above the p_T cut
	Lead_pt: p_{T} of the leading jet in the event
	Subleading_pt: P_{T} of the leading jet's partner if one exists
	Lead_eta: pseduorapidity of leading jet axis
	Subleading_eta: pseudorapidity of leading jet's partner axis (if one exists)
	delta_phi: difference between leading and subleading jet axis phis
	ohcal_ratio: Percentage of energy deposited in the OHCAL of total energy in event
	isDijet: Dijet requirement met
	negE: negative total energy identified
	passes: all cuts are passed by the event

EEC--Holds information about the energy-energy correlator for later analysis
	E_Total--Total calorimeter energy 
	E_CEMC -- Energy in EMCAL
	E_IHCAL -- Energy in IHCAL
	E_OHCAL -- Energy in OHCAL
	vertex -- x,y,z posistion of vertex 
	2_pt -- 2 point energy correlator (WIP branch)
		Map of Region stored as Int (full, towards, away, transverse):
			For each calorimeter map of [R_L:e2c]
	3_pt -- 3 point energy correlator (WIP branch)
		Map of Region stored as Int (full, towards, away, transverse):
			For each calorimeter map of [R_L:e2c]

	3_pt_full -- 3 point energy correlator with full shape (WIP branch)
		Map of region stored as Int (full, towards, away, transverse):
			For each calorimeter a map of 
				array of distances [R_{12/L}, R_{13}, R_{23}]:
					e3c
JetEvtObs--Holds info for analysis of kinematics using the method in the above paper
	p_T-- pt stored in way allowing for event shape varaible analysis (WIP branch)
		Map of region stored as Int (full, towards, away, transverse):
			For each calorimeter map of 
				[Tower Eta, tower phi]:

Histograms:
TH1:
	MethodHistograms for Full calorimeter, Towards, away and transverse regions defined relative to leading jet axis

	emcal_occup: Occupancy of towers (%) in the emcal per event
	ihcal_occup: Occupancy of towers (%) in the ihcal per event
	ohcal_occup: Occupancy of towers (%) in the ohcal per event
TH2:
	ohcal_rat_occup: Occupancy of the ohcal and energy in "streak" events: x->(%) energy deposition in ohcal, y->(%) occupancy of towers in ohcal
	ohcal_bad_hits: Location of energy deposition of "streak" events: x->phi, y->eta, z->hits
	bad_occ_em_oh: Emcal to OHCAL occupancy of "streak" events: x-> (%) ooccupancy emcal towers, y->(%) occupancy ohcal towers
	em_allh_bad_hits: EMCAL to  all hcal occupancy of "streak" events: x->(%) occupancy emcal towers, y-> average (%) occupancy of hcal towers

Currently runs ok on MC data, adding in some fixes to get the real data running better including a more correct jet reco
still need to create the proper dictionary for the ttree to read in the maps correctly
