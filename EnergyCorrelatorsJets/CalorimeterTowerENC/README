This is an analysis node to allow fpr the comparison of a jet with fully identified particle components to the towers of the region of an identified jet for the impact of the ENC. 
Right now, it takes in the truth jet from the TRUTH_JET DST nodes and gets the data on the calos from the DST_CALO_CLUSTER nodes. Next step would be to use the reco form instead of the base truth object to introduce a bettter set of detector effects
