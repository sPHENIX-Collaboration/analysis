########################################## Herwig to HepMC File Generator ###########################################################

Author: Skaydi
Last Update 13 January 2026 


This is a stop gap solution to allow for the generation of HepMC files from a Herwig input.
Temporary fix before "PHHerwig" can be properly implemented

How it works is generate a .run file, run the makeHerwigJobs script and give it the parameters relevant to the run (run with help option at first for explination of the behavior)
this will generate a number of events broken into a set number of files with an equal number of events per file, triggers for Jets can be optionally employed 
#Directories
The directories are broken down as follows

##config_files

This is where the Herwig input (.in) and run (.run) files live as

After adding a new ".in" File simply do /cvmfs/sphenix.sdcc.bnl.gov/gcc-12.1.0/opt/sphenix/core/Herwig/bin/Herwig read [.in File name]

## HepMCTrigger

This has the Jet trigger that is implemented on the HepMC output, eventually will add other triggers. 
This is based on anti-kt r=0.4 jets from fastjet

## HerwigHepMCFilter

A specific instance of running the filter that applies a trigger and a set event output per file number

"Run

## HepMC_scripts

This is where the main usage is. 

"condor_blank.job" should be updated for the user 

"condor_file_dir" this is where the condor files go. 

"Herwig_run.sh" this is what the condor job calls, runs events with a random seed and optionally applies a triger

"makeHerwigJobs.sh" script to input parameters of the run 
This script runs Herwig to create HepMC files given an input configuration
Options:
  
 -h, --help		Display this help message
 -v, --verbose		Enable verbose job creation (Default false) 
 -N, --events  		Number of events to generate (Default 1M) 
 -n, --perfile		Number of events per file (Default 1k) 
 -s, --submit		Make and submit condor jobs (Default false)
 -t, --trigger		Input type (MB, Jet10, Jet20, Jet30, PhotonJet5, PhotonJet10, PhotonJet20) (Default MB)
 -j, --jetcut		Add a Jet cut filter [Integer GeV] (Default None) 
 -p, --photoncut	Add a photon cut filter [Integer GeV] (Default None) 
 -i, --input 		Specify new input file (Default blank)



####################################### USAGE ##########################################

To use and understand this package is relatively staightforwards

# -----------------STEPS----------------------
##Step 1
Activate local LHAPATH (needed for Nashville tune)
	export LHAPATH=$(pwd)/HerwigToHepMCProduction/config_files:$LHAPATH
	export LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=$(pwd)/config_files:$LHAPDF_DATA_PATH
##Step 2
run the script
	cd HepMC_scripts
	./makeHeriwgJobs.sh [options listed above]
##Step 3 
Interpreting the cross section
For the cross sections, those are output in a text file
	"Cross_Section_[TAG].txt"

### A note on cross sections
So in order to keep a fixed 1000 good events per DST for reconstruction, the filter requires that we construct far too many events
The cross section is calculated by taking the output cross section from the Herwig generator, and scaling it 
 
	XS/N = XS_HERWIG / N_Generated * 1000 / N_passing_filter
